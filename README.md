# Bill-Divider-Web-App

This is a small web-based application that allows customers to divide a check at a restaurant. Some features:
- The user will input however many people they are dividing the bill with, the total cost of each person's items, the subtotal, tax, and intended tip percentage.
- The amount of tip/tax owed by each person is proportional to the items that they ordered, rather than simply being split evenly across all of the customers.
- Styling/sizing is optimized for both mobile and desktop.
