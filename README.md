# Bill-Divider-Web-App

Living in NYC, I frequently go to restaurants with groups of friends. In some cases, some people will order drinks, apetizers, and entrees, and others barely order anything. The question of how to split the bill at the end of the meal is always a bit awkward to handle. Additionally, I recently learned the fundamentals of client-side JavaScript, and I was looking to get some more practice with it. Hence, I made this small application that calculates the portion of tip and tax owed by each person for a given bill.

This is a small web-based application that allows customers to divide a check at a restaurant. Some features:
- The user will input however many people they are dividing the bill with, the total cost of each person's items, the subtotal, tax, and intended tip percentage.
- The amount of tip/tax owed by each person is proportional to the items that they ordered, rather than simply being split evenly across all of the customers.
- Styling/sizing is optimized for both mobile and desktop.
